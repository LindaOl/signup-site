# Business Signup Site
- Assignment to make a signup form with a variety of input types and a hero image/video at the top of the page.
- Should also be responsive to certain devices/screen sizes

## Appproach
- Browsed to find a video I could use and to inspire how the form could look and what elements to have.
- Began with the basic html for a header and the form
- Started styling
- Added divs to make it work as grid and flexbox elements
- Continued doing smaller changes, adding divs and styling changes
- Had some issues with the form not sending every time, but got it sorted
- Trial and error to make things work untill it mostly did
- Did notice how my radio buttons got unchecked when the checkbox was used. Trying to find out why.

## If I had time, what would be next?
- Try out new layouts
- Try to make the hero image be on one side and the form on the other on desktop screens, but that wasn't the assignment. I'm thinkig styling and positioning would have other types of challenges to deal with then.
