- Assignment to make a signup form with a variety of input types and a hero image/video at the top of the page.
- Should also be responsive to certain devices/screen sizes

## Appproach
- First off I missed the part to fork a respo, so I made my own. On my github there is a public respo with the one I actually worked in. Will fork one, and upload the same there, to make it connected to the original respo.
- Browsed to find a video I could use and to inspire how the form could look and what elements to have.
- Began with the basic html for a header and the form
- Started styling
- Added divs to make it work as grid and flexbox elements
- Continued doing smaller changes, adding divs and styling changes
- Had some issues with the form not sending every time, but got it sorted
- Trial and error to make things work untill it mostly did
- Did notice how my radio buttons got unchecked when the checkbox was used. Trying to find out why.
- Tools: Visual Studios, ChatGPT to ask questions when about why thing weren't working or to explain concepts. Google to find answers when needed. Trying to make the different screen types look slightly different to practice making things work.
- Techniques: Planning and finding inspiration. Making a basic layout to add the different main elements. Start styling, and going for "Mobile first", then adapt to tablet and desktop. Make adjustments, make changes and deal with issues till I'm done.

## If I had time, what would be next?
- Try out new layouts
- Try to make the hero image be on one side and the form on the other on desktop screens, but that wasn't the assignment. I'm thinking styling and positioning would have other types of challenges to deal with then.
